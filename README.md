# Pluggable Data-Driven Card System

This project is a modular and extensible React card component system that dynamically renders data using configurable layouts, fields, markers, and actions. It's designed to be easily integrated into a larger React codebase.

## Features

- **Data-Driven:** Cards are rendered based on a JSON configuration and a data object.
- **Configurable Layouts:** Use CSS Grid to define the layout of fields within a card.
- **Extensible Field Types:** Easily add new field types with custom rendering logic.
- **Dynamic Markers:** Display status badges, triggers, and tags based on data values.
- **Configurable Actions:** Add action buttons with customizable labels and onClick handlers.
- **Themable:** Cards can be styled with different color themes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd card_system
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: Contains the reusable React components for the card system.
  - `Card.tsx`: The main pluggable card component.
- `src/data`: Contains mock data and card configurations.
  - `mockData.ts`: Sample data for the cards.
  - `cardConfigs.ts`: Configuration files for different card types.
- `src/types`: Contains TypeScript interfaces for the card system.
  - `index.ts`: Defines the shapes of the configuration and data objects.
- `src/App.tsx`: The main application component that renders the example cards.

## How to Use

The main application entry point is `src/App.tsx`, which renders the `Dashboard` component. The dashboard is composed of generic `Card` components configured via `cardConfigs.ts` and data from `incidents.ts` and `stats.ts`.

To modify the content of the dashboard, you can edit these data files and/or the card configuration in `cardConfigs.ts`.

### Example Configurations & Data

Here are three examples of the data structures used to render the cards in the dashboard.

#### 1. Loan Origination Stat Card

This card displays key metrics for a department. The `status` field controls the color of the tag, and the `metrics` array is rendered in a 2-column grid.

**File:** `src/data/stats.ts`

```typescript
{
  id: '1',
  title: 'Loan Origination',
  status: 'on track',
  metrics: [
    { label: 'Active Loans', value: '156' },
    { label: 'Avg. Processing', value: '3.2 days' },
    { label: "Today's Applications", value: '23' },
    { label: 'Approval Rate', value: '78%' },
  ],
  efficiency: 89,
}
```

#### 2. High-Value Loan Default Incident Card

This card is used for critical alerts. It includes `severity` and `status` fields that are rendered as colored tags. It also conditionally displays fields like `daysOverdue` and will hide the `amount` field if it is 0.

> **Note:** The badge colors for `HIGH` and `ESCALATED` are now `bg-red-100 text-red-500`.

**File:** `src/data/incidents.ts`

```typescript
{
  id: '1',
  title: 'High-Value Loan Default Alert',
  severity: 'HIGH',
  status: 'ESCALATED',
  description: 'Commercial loan #LA-2024-9847 ($1.8M) missed payment - immediate action required',
  assignedTo: 'Senior Collections Manager',
  time: '8 minutes ago',
  amount: 1800000, // If 0, this field is hidden in the UI
  daysOverdue: 15,
}
```

#### 3. Underwriting Stat Card

This example shows a stat card with the `attention needed` status, which changes the color of the status tag to indicate that the department requires review.

**File:** `src/data/stats.ts`

```typescript
{
  id: '3',
  title: 'Underwriting',
  status: 'attention needed',
  metrics: [
    { label: 'Active Loans', value: '67' },
    { label: 'Avg. Processing', value: '1.8 days' },
    { label: "Today's Applications", value: '45' },
    { label: 'Approval Rate', value: '76%' },
  ],
  efficiency: 85,
}
```

## Extensibility

### Adding a New Field, Marker, or Action Type

- Update the `FieldConfig`, `MarkerConfig`, or `ActionConfig` interface in `src/types/index.ts` to include the new type or property.
- Update the configuration in `src/data/cardConfigs.ts` to use the new type or property as needed.
- The generic `Card` component in `src/components/Card.tsx` will automatically render new types if you add the appropriate rendering logic there.

No need to create or edit separate renderer filesâ€”everything is now handled via config and the pluggable Card component.

## Bonus Features

### Drag-and-Drop Card Designer UI

A visual Card Designer is available in `src/components/CardDesigner.tsx`. This tool allows you to:
- View and reorder card fields (drag-and-drop editing coming soon)
- Export the current card config as JSON
- Import a card config from JSON

To use the designer, render the `CardDesigner` component in your app and pass an initial config if desired.

### Export/Import Card Configs as JSON

- Use the export button in the Card Designer to download the current config as a JSON file.
- Paste a JSON config into the import area and click Import to load it into the designer.

### Custom Data Transformations

You can add a `transform` function or key to your card config to support computed fields, aggregations, or filters. See `cardConfigs.ts` for examples of mapping helpers.
