# Pluggable Data-Driven Card System

This project is a modular and extensible React card component system that dynamically renders data using configurable layouts, fields, markers, and actions. It's designed to be easily integrated into a larger React codebase.

## Features

- **Data-Driven:** Cards are rendered based on a JSON configuration and a data object.
- **Configurable Layouts:** Use CSS Grid to define the layout of fields within a card.
- **Extensible Field Types:** Easily add new field types with custom rendering logic.
- **Dynamic Markers:** Display status badges, triggers, and tags based on data values.
- **Configurable Actions:** Add action buttons with customizable labels and onClick handlers.
- **Themable:** Cards can be styled with different color themes.
- **Drag-and-Drop Card Designer:** Visually create, edit, and export/import card configs as JSON.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd card_system
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: Contains the reusable React components for the card system.
  - `Card.tsx`: The main pluggable card component.
  - `CardDesigner.tsx`: Visual designer for card configs.
  - `Dashboard.tsx`: Example dashboard using cards and configs.
- `src/data`: Contains mock data and card configurations as JSON files.
  - `customerOnboardingCardConfig.json`, `incidents.json`, `stats.json`, etc.
- `src/types`: Contains TypeScript interfaces for the card system.
  - `index.ts`: Defines the shapes of the configuration and data objects.
- `src/App.tsx`: The main application component that renders the dashboard and designer.

## How to Use

The main application entry point is `src/App.tsx`, which lets you switch between the `Dashboard` and the `CardDesigner` via navigation tabs.

### Using the Card Designer

- **Add/Edit Fields:** Add, remove, reorder, and edit all field properties (label, dataKey, type, style, etc.).
- **Markers:** Add, remove, and edit markers (status, trigger, tag) and their data keys.
- **Actions:** Add, remove, and edit action buttons (label, type).
- **Card Meta:** Edit card title, theme, and layout (rows/cols).
- **Custom Data Transform:** Add a JS function body to compute or transform data for the card.
- **Export/Import:**
  - Export your card config as JSON for use in the dashboard.
  - Import any valid card config JSON to edit or extend it.
- **Default Data:** The designer uses realistic mock data for preview and export.

### Using JSON Card Configs in the Dashboard

1. **Export** your card config as JSON from the Card Designer.
2. **Save** the JSON file in `src/data/` (e.g., `customerOnboardingCardConfig.json`).
3. **Import** the JSON in your dashboard code:
   ```typescript
   import customerOnboardingCardConfig from '../data/customerOnboardingCardConfig.json';
   ```
4. **TypeScript:** If you see a type error, use `as CardConfig`:
   ```typescript
   import { CardConfig } from '../types';
   const config = customerOnboardingCardConfig as CardConfig;
   ```
5. **Provide data** for the card:
   ```typescript
   const customerOnboardingData = {
     successRate: 97,
     totalRuns: 120,
     avgDuration: 2.3,
     lastRun: '2024-07-07',
     status: 'on track',
     triggers: 'auto'
   };
   ```
6. **Render the card:**
   ```tsx
   <Card config={config} data={customerOnboardingData} />
   ```

## Example Card Config JSON

```json
{
  "id": "card-1",
  "title": "Customer Onboarding",
  "theme": "green",
  "layout": { "rows": 2, "cols": 2 },
  "fields": [
    { "id": "f1", "label": "Success Rate", "dataKey": "successRate", "type": "percentage", "position": { "row": 0, "col": 0 }, "style": { "fontSize": "2xl", "fontWeight": "bold", "color": "#16a34a" } },
    { "id": "f2", "label": "Total Runs", "dataKey": "totalRuns", "type": "number", "position": { "row": 0, "col": 1 } },
    { "id": "f3", "label": "Avg Duration", "dataKey": "avgDuration", "type": "number", "position": { "row": 1, "col": 0 } },
    { "id": "f4", "label": "Last Run", "dataKey": "lastRun", "type": "text", "position": { "row": 1, "col": 1 } }
  ],
  "markers": [
    { "type": "status", "valueKey": "status" },
    { "type": "trigger", "valueKey": "triggers" }
  ],
  "actions": [
    { "label": "Pause", "actionType": "pause" },
    { "label": "Edit", "actionType": "edit" }
  ]
}
```

## Extensibility

### Adding a New Field, Marker, or Action Type

- Update the `FieldConfig`, `MarkerConfig`, or `ActionConfig` interface in `src/types/index.ts` to include the new type or property.
- Update the configuration in your JSON file to use the new type or property as needed.
- The generic `Card` component in `src/components/Card.tsx` will automatically render new types if you add the appropriate rendering logic there.

No need to create or edit separate renderer filesâ€”everything is now handled via config and the pluggable Card component.

## Bonus Features

### Drag-and-Drop Card Designer UI

A visual Card Designer is available in `src/components/CardDesigner.tsx`. This tool allows you to:
- Add, edit, remove, and reorder card fields (drag-and-drop)
- Edit all field properties, markers, actions, and card meta
- Export the current card config as JSON
- Import a card config from JSON
- Add a custom data transform (JS function body)

To use the designer, render the `CardDesigner` component in your app and pass an initial config if desired, or use the navigation tabs to switch between the dashboard and designer.

### Export/Import Card Configs as JSON

- Use the export button in the Card Designer to download the current config as a JSON file.
- Paste a JSON config into the import area and click Import to load it into the designer.

### Custom Data Transformations

You can add a `transform` function or key to your card config to support computed fields, aggregations, or filters. This can be edited as a JS function body in the Card Designer.
